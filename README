How to install
==============

Start Configure.app, select video driver and click the Add button.
In the driver panel click the Install Driver button and select MatroxMGA.config

The driver supports two additional keywords that can be set in the Expert panel of Configure.app:

"MGA Memory Size" = "size in MB"  Tell the driver how much memory has your card.
"MGA Sync On Green" = "YES/NO"    Switch the output signal to Sync On Green mode.


Known bugs
==========

The 8 bit color video mode is pretty unusable due to improper use of the gamma table.
